            <doing Title="What youll do">From a 1970s office block to one of the world’s most distinguished buildings, ascend to London’s highest viewpoint at The View from The Shard.
                Journey to a height of up to 800ft (244m); to the top of London’s tallest observation platform and premium visitor attraction, The View from The Shard. Formerly known as the London Bridge Tower, ‘The Shard’ was designed by famed architect, Renzo Piano. Piano, who is most famous for designing the Pompidou Centre in Paris, France, began designing The Shard in 2000. His design was fuelled by the desire to create a modern building that stood out amongst the London Skyline without appearing too overbearing. As such, the building resembles a large piece of glass pointing out of the ground, and thus, The Shard was aptly named.
                Piano’s design has become a symbol of modern architecture in contemporary London. It incorporates both aesthetically and structurally unique features, drawing inspiration from the spires of different London churches. The building’s windows have a special glaze that reacts to light in a very intuitive way. Depending on the season or time of day, the glass can reflect different intensities of light, casting unique luminosity.
                The entire building process took over three years to complete. In that time, the structure rose by 10 feet per day. Many of the glass panels were put in place before the building reached its terminal height of 1000 feet. By 2012, it officially became the tallest building in Europe.
                The Shard offers a multitude of corporate, entertainment and dining facilities. Floors 2 to 28 of the building are used as office space rental areas. The 31st to 33rd floors are dedicated to restaurants. The five-star hotel, Shangri-La takes up a staggering 18 levels, from the 34th floor to the 52nd floor. Some can even call The Shard their home, as floors 53 to 65 are occupied by residential apartments.
                The best viewing spot in The Shard is, of course, its pinnacle. Enjoy unparalleled views over London from the building’s multi-floor observatory on the 68th to 72nd floors.</doing>

            <spending_time> Up to an hour (&lt;1 hr)</spending_time>
            <doing Title="What youll do">The Household Cavalry Museum gets you up close to The King’s Mounted Bodyguard. Explore their history and discover more about their present-day role. The museum offers views into the working stables operated by the regiment and tells the story of The Household Cavalry through compelling personal testimonies, interactivity and rare artifacts.
                The Household Cavalry Museum located at the Horse Guards in Whitehall is one of the most historic buildings in the city. Dating back to 1750, the building is still the headquarters of the Army in London. Visitors to the museum learn about the traditions of the Household Cavalry and experience the daily ceremony of the King’s Life Guard that has remained unchanged since its founding in 1660. The museum's location provides a unique backdrop that helps immerse visitors in the rich history and ongoing activities of the regiment.
                Opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2007, The Household Cavalry Museum offers a unique behind-the-scenes perspective on two vital British Army regiments - the Life Guards and the Blues &amp; Royals - and both the ceremonial and operational duties they perform. It offers a metaphorical and literal window into the prestigious history and everyday workings of the Household Cavalry, with a large glazed partition through which visitors see troopers tending to their horses in the original 18th century stables and a wealth of exhibitions covering the regiments’ history in theatres of conflict and during Royal ceremonial occasions.
                This is a living museum, giving access to the heart of the modern working environment of a place the Household Cavalry has guarded for well over 350 years. The King’s Life Guard ceremony is performed here each morning, as is the daily afternoon inspection. The Household Cavalry Museum pairs the everyday activities at Horse Guards with a wealth of interactive exhibits, as well as personal testimonies from troopers regarding their training and responsibilities. There’s even the opportunity to try on the iconic uniform for yourself and dress like a cavalryman.

                <Facts>
                    <Fact>The afternoon inspection of guards and horses began in 1894 when Queen Victoria discovered the guards drinking and gambling instead of performing their protective duties. She doled out her punishment: the guards would be inspected at 4PM daily for the next 100 years.</Fact>
                    <Fact>In 1994, when the royal punishment officially expired, Queen Elizabeth II elected to persist with the daily inspections because by then they were a firmly established tradition.</Fact>
